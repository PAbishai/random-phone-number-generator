# random-phone-number-generator
There is a startup that generates random phone numbers for a telecommunications company. You are tasked as the developer to work on this project. The length of a phone number has to be 10 digits (all starting with zero) and should always be unique. Present an efficient application in React.js (or Angular, or Node, or VueJs…. anything, depending on your stack).   Note that, due to financial reasons, they can't purchase a database right now and would like to use their existing file storage to hold everything. As part of auditing, they would want to know the total number of phone numbers generated and the list of numbers anytime. While treating the phone numbers as integers, they would want to sort all generated numbers in ascending/descending order as well as find the max and min generated number. The company doesn’t need a huge number of phone numbers generated at any given time-- 10,000 would be plenty (a file size of 3-4 MB at maximum). If you run the generator twice, it should produce new numbers each time.
